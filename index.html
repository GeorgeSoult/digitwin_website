						<h2>Transforming Healthcare: From Treating Illness to Improving Wellness</h2>
						<p>Today's healthcare system is more about treating illness than preventing it. It focuses on managing symptoms with medications, surgeries, and hospital visits‚Äîreacting only after problems arise. This approach, often called "sick care," leads to rising costs and a never-ending cycle of chronic disease management, without truly addressing the root causes of conditions like heart disease and diabetes.</p>
						<p>We believe healthcare should be different. Instead of waiting for illness to develop, we need a proactive, personalized, and data-driven approach that helps people live longer, healthier lives.</p>

						<h2>A New Vision: Personalized, AI-Powered Health Optimization</h2>
						<p>We‚Äôre pioneering a Digital Twin Model, powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and real-time health monitoring, to extend healthspan‚Äîthe number of years you live in good health. This revolutionary technology uses deep data insights to provide:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Personalized Health Recommendations ‚Äì AI-driven guidance tailored to your unique biology, lifestyle, and environment.</li>
							<li>Early Detection & Prevention ‚Äì Identifying risks before disease develops, so you can take action sooner</li>
							<li>Continuous, Adaptive Support ‚Äì Dynamic recommendations that evolve with your health and goals.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Our approach is participatory (empowering you with actionable insights), preventive (catching issues early), and precision-driven (customized to your individual needs). This isn‚Äôt just about living longer‚Äîit‚Äôs about thriving.</p>

						<h2>How Digital Twins Revolutionize Health</h2>
						<p>Advancements in AI and Machine Learning (ML) now allow us to analyze massive amounts of data and create virtual health models, or Digital Twins. These models act as real-time simulations of your body, monitoring key health indicators and predicting risks with incredible accuracy.</p>
						<p>Our two key objectives for Digital Twin technology in healthcare:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Real-Time Health Tracking & AI-Powered Guidance ‚Äì A digital health companion that provides expert-level insights into your well-being.</li>
							<li>Early Intervention for Preventive Care ‚Äì Proactively identifying risks before symptoms appear, reducing the need for expensive treatments later.</li>

						<h2>Starting with Cardiovascular Health‚ÄîThen Expanding to All Areas of Wellness</h2>
						<p>Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, yet current prevention strategies rely on outdated risk assessments. Many approaches overlook key factors like inflammation, genetics, and emerging biomarkers, leading to one-size-fits-all solutions that don‚Äôt work for everyone.</p>
						<p>Our Digital Twin technology personalizes prevention by integrating advanced data analysis, real-time biomarker tracking, and AI-driven insights. This means more precise predictions, better interventions, and healthcare tailored to you. While we‚Äôre starting with cardiovascular health, this model can be expanded to optimize all aspects of wellness.</p>

						<h2>Redefining What It Means to Be Healthy</h2>
						<p>True health isn‚Äôt just about avoiding disease‚Äîit‚Äôs about actively shaping your well-being. Health is dynamic, influenced by lifestyle, environment, psychology, and biology. With a proactive, personalized approach, we can help individuals not only prevent disease but improve overall health outcomes and quality of life.</p>

						<h3>Data is the key</h3>
						<p>Mount Sinai is undertaking a pioneering new study to develop the tools and data modeling needed to transform healthcare using Digital Twin models. Our goal is to amass a comprehensive profile of health data in a cohort of 1,000 individuals within the next 3-5 years. The health data that will be collected will span established clinical laboratory and physical function tests, state-of-the-art whole body MRI imaging, state-of-the-art genetics and multiomics tests, comprehensive lifestyle questionnaire data collection, and use of novel at-home sensors and devices for monitoring activity and health. The depth and breadth of health measures is designed to capture molecular, cellular, organ-level, and organism level data so we can understand how systems interact with each other and impact overall health.</p>
						<h3> Putting it all together </h3>
						<p>Once we have assembled the Heart Health Digital Twin cohort data, we will develop next-generation AI and ML modeling to interpret the data. Sophisticated machine learning analysis will perform individual phenotyping to discover novel insights into health at any one moment and trajectories in health markers over time ‚Äì critical for meeting the objective of real-time health tracking and recognizing the signs for preventive intervention. Next, we will use AI to learn how lifestyle and health interact and develop models that provide personalized feedback to optimize the effect lifestyle has on health ‚Äì meeting our objective to provide adaptable, expert-level guidance.</p>
						<h3>What‚Äôs Involved</h3>
						<p>The data collected for the study will encompass the molecular, cellular, and organ-level function of all the key organs and organ systems in the body including the brain, heart, lungs, liver, pancreas, and gut. Other tests will provide data on the individual as a whole.</p>

					<h2>An intuitive smartphone app facilitates data collection from at-home tests and survey answers.</h2>
					<p>The <strong>eHive smartphone app</strong> ‚Äì developed by Mount Sinai researchers ‚Äì provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for study participants to provide informed consent to participate during enrollment into the study and for collecting self-reported health and lifestyle data from in-app questionnaires during the study. The app also provides a convenient way for researchers and participants to stay in touch, answer questions, and receive reminders to complete study tests and schedule study appointments at our center in NYC. The app also connects to smart devices at home and facilitates seamless integration of study data in a secure (HIPAA compliant) database to enable researchers to develop AI/ML models.</p>

					<h2>Study Design</h2>
					<p>The study will be conducted over 24 months, with tests conducted during annual visits to our center at Mount Sinai in NYC, and others conducted at-home. A baseline visit will be conducted upon enrollment with follow up visits after 1 and 2 years. In between, participants will receive test devices in the mail for blood collection and blood sugar monitoring. Other tests will be completed daily or continuously, such as the Oura ring activity monitor and the air quality monitor.</p>
